# AuTomtit
We intend to build a powerful time-saving downloading tool which include a web crawler searching for the best sources, a downloader downloading as fast as possible and a server allows you to view the result anywhere.

The AuTomtit will working on any devices running Unix-like OS such as a Raspberry Pi. The only thing you need to do is input the key words and AuTomtit will do all the other things for you automatically 24-7.

First, we plan to achieve downloading films and TV series. We have already achieved grabbing magnets from some search engine and a very simple static server. We use Python as the main development language. looking forward to your joining us!

To use the current function of AuTomtit, you need to install python2 and beautiful soup 4. You can run file WebCraler.py in directory WebCrawler to start the program.
